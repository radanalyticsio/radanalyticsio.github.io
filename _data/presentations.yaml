- title: Teaching Apache Spark Clusters to Manage Their Workers Elastically
  presentor: Erik Erlandson, Trevor Mckay
  abstract: |-
    Devops engineers have applied a great deal of creativity and energy to invent tools that automate infrastructure management, in the service of deploying capable and functional applications. For data-driven applications running on Apache Spark, the details of instantiating and managing the backing Spark cluster can be a distraction from focusing on the application logic. In the spirit of devops, automating Spark cluster management tasks allows engineers to focus their attention on application code that provides value to end-users.

    Using Openshift Origin as a laboratory, we implemented a platform where Apache Spark applications create their own clusters and then dynamically manage their own scale via host-platform APIs. This makes it possible to launch a fully elastic Spark application with little more than the click of a button.

    We will present a live demo of turn-key deployment for elastic Apache Spark applications, and share what we’ve learned about developing Spark applications that manage their own resources dynamically with platform APIs.

    The audience for this talk will be anyone looking for ways to streamline their Apache Spark cluster management, reduce the workload for Spark application deployment, or create self-scaling elastic applications. Attendees can expect to learn about leveraging APIs in the Kubernetes ecosystem that enable application deployments to manipulate their own scale elastically.

- title: Sketching Data with T-Digest In Apache Spark
  presentor: Erik Erlandson
  abstract: |-
    Algorithms for sketching probability distributions from large data sets are a fundamental building block of modern data science. Sketching plays a role in diverse applications ranging from visualization, optimizing data encodings, estimating quantiles, data synthesis and imputation. The T-Digest is a versatile sketching data structure. It operates on any numeric data, models tricky distribution tails with high fidelity, and most crucially it works smoothly with aggregators and map-reduce.

    T-Digest is a perfect fit for Apache Spark; it is single-pass and intermediate results can be aggregated across partitions in batch jobs or aggregated across windows in streaming jobs. In this talk I will describe a native Scala implementation of the T-Digest sketching algorithm and demonstrate its use in Spark applications for visualization, quantile estimations and data synthesis.

    Attendees of this talk will leave with an understanding of data sketching with T-Digest sketches, and insights about how to apply T-Digest to their own data analysis applications.

- title: "Optimizing Spark Deployments for Containers: Isolation, Safety, and Performance"
  presentor: William Benton
  abstract: |-
    Developers love Linux containers, which neatly package up an application and its dependencies and are easy to create and share. However, this unbeatable developer experience hides some deployment challenges for real applications: how do you wire together pieces of a multi-container application? Where do you store your persistent data if your containers are ephemeral? Do containers really contain and isolate your application, or are they merely hiding potential security vulnerabilities? Are your containers scheduled across your compute resources efficiently, or are they trampling on one another?

    Container application platforms like Kubernetes provide the answers to some of these questions. We’ll draw on expertise in Linux security, distributed scheduling, and the Java Virtual Machine to dig deep on the performance and security implications of running in containers. This talk will provide a deep dive into tuning and orchestrating containerized Spark applications. You’ll leave this talk with an understanding of the relevant issues, best practices for containerizing data-processing workloads, and tips for taking advantage of the latest features and fixes in Linux Containers, the JDK, and Kubernetes. You’ll leave inspired and enabled to deploy high-performance Spark applications without giving up the security you need or the developer-friendly workflow you want.

- title: Building My Own Little World with Open Data
  presentor: Steven Poutsy
  abstract: |-
    Everybody cares about the place (they live, they grew up in, they had a great vacation, in the news….). With the rise of open data, big data tooling, and new visualisation technology, we can actually now build applications that give people new ways to explore beyond “where is the closest Starbucks”. I have collected Open Data from my home town (Santa Cruz, CA) and compiled it into the beginnings of a visualization and analysis platform. The goal of this talk is to show the process of collecting open data from disparate sources, some of the caveats on being able to put them together, general lessons learned, and some fun visualizations. I want to move past thinking about sources for open data and moving on to tools and lessons so you can get cracking! I want to show how we can enable people to gather open data and turn it to open knowledge. Data sources will be from Government (e.g. United States Geologic Survey) and Non-Government sources (e.g Audubon Society eBird Data) while some of the tools covered will be Apache Spark, PostGIS, Leaflet, and various others.

- title: Building Cloud Native Apache Spark Applications with OpenShift
  presentor: Michael McCune
  abstract: |-
    Apache Spark based applications are often comprised of many separate, interconnected components that are a good match for an orchestrated containerized platform like OpenShift which is built on Kubernetes. But with the increased flexibility afforded by these technologies comes a new set of challenges for building rich data-centric applications. Mike starts off with how to build Apache Spark Application pipelines and then walks thru a demo of building one on OpenShift. He also gave some great insights into the road ahead for Apache Spark on OpenShift.

- title: "Big Data In Production: Bare Metal to OpenShift"
  presentor: William Benton
  abstract: |-
    Apache Spark is one of the most exciting open-source data-processing frameworks today. It features a range of useful capabilities and an unusually developer-friendly programming model. However, the ease of getting a simple Spark application running can hide some of the challenges you might face while going from a proof of concept to a real-world application. This talk will distill our experiences as early adopters of Spark in production, present a case study where using Spark effectively provided huge benefits over legacy solutions, explain why we migrated from a dedicated Spark cluster to OpenShift, and provide concrete advice regarding:

    * how to integrate Spark with external data sources (including databases, in-memory data grids, and message queues),
    * how best to deploy and manage Spark in the cloud,
    * the tradeoffs of various archive storage options for Spark,
    * how to evaluate predictive models and make sense of the analytic components of insightful applications, and
    * integrating Spark into microservice applications on OpenShift

    This talk assumes some familiarity with Apache Spark but will provide context for attendees who are new to Spark. You’ll learn from a seasoned Red Hat engineer with over three years of experience running Spark in production and contributing to the Spark community.

- title: Insightful Apps with Apache Spark and OpenShift
  presentor: William Benton, Michael McCune
  abstract: |-
    Nearly all of today’s most exciting applications are insightful applications: they employ machine learning and large-scale data processing to improve with longevity and popularity. It’s an easy bet that the important applications of tomorrow will be insightful as well. It’s also an easy bet that you’ll want to be deploying tomorrow’s applications on a contemporary container platform with a great developer workflow like OpenShift.

    Insightful applications pose some new challenges for developers, but this hands-on workshop will show you how to navigate them confidently. You'll learn how to develop an insightful application on OpenShift with Apache Spark from the ground up. We’ll cover:

    * architectures for analytic applications and microservices;
    * a crash course in Apache Spark, some data science techniques, and OpenShift;
    * how to deploy Apache Spark as part of an OpenShift application; and
    * building a data-driven application from the ground up.

    This workshop is largely self-contained: the only prerequisite is some familiarity with Python. Learn from the experience of Red Hat emerging technology engineers who are focused on bringing data-driven application development to OpenShift!

- title: Converging Big Data and Application Infrastructure
  presentor: Steve Poutsy
  abstract: |-
    For most of my lifetime in the computing world, data crunching and web serving were two very separate worlds. If a web app wanted access to the analysis there was a long process of ETL, DB works, imports and exports, and bribing various network and storage people for the resources you needed. With the rise of containers, orchestration, cheap computing and networking, and over 10 years of people tackling large problems at new scales we have finally come to a convergence. It is now possible for us to actually use the same hardware, and more importantly, clustering software to converge both types of workloads. I am going to lay out how this can look with Containers, Kubernetes, web servers, and Apache Spark. This can be considered a germ of what we can look to build in the future. I will demo this in action and show this is actually now achievable for mere mortals such as myself. Finally I will close with some thought experiments on what this can enable for the future. I know this is a keynote but I am hoping we can make it interactive with discussion and experience sharing!

- title: Building Apache Spark Application Pipelines for the Kubernetes Ecosystem
  presentor: Michael McCune
  abstract: |-
    Apache Spark based applications are often comprised of many separate, interconnected components that are a good match for an orchestrated containerized platform like Kubernetes. But with the increased flexibility afforded by these technologies comes a new set challenges for building rich data-centric applications.

    In this presentation we will discuss techniques for building multi-component Apache Spark based applications that can be easily deployed and managed on a Kubernetes infrastructure. Building on experiences learned while developing and deploying cloud native applications on an OpenShift platform, we will explore common issues that arise during the engineering process and demonstrate workflows for easing the maintenance factors associated with complex installations.

- title: Running Apache Spark Natively on Kubernetes with OpenShift
  presentor: Erik Erlandson
  abstract: |-
    Apache Spark can be made natively aware of Kubernetes by implementing a Spark scheduler back-end that can run Spark application Drivers and bare Executors in kubernetes pods. In this talk, Erik will explain the design of a native-Kubernetes scheduler back-end in Spark and demonstrate a Spark application submission with OpenShift.

- title: Containerized Spark on Kubernetes
  presentor: William Benton
  abstract: |-
    Consider two recent trends in application development: more and more applications are taking advantage of architectures involving containerized microservices in order to enable improved elasticity, fault-tolerance, and scalability — whether in the public cloud or on-premise. In addition, analytic capabilities and scalable data processing have increasingly become a basic requirement for contemporary applications. The confluence of these trends suggests that there are a lot of good reasons to want to manage Spark with a container orchestration platform, but it’s not quite as simple as packaging up a standalone cluster in containers. This talk will present our team’s experiences migrating a production Spark cluster from a multi-tenant Mesos cluster to a shared compute resource managed by Kubernetes. We’ll explain the motivation behind microservices and containers and identify the architectures that make sense for containerized applications that depend on Spark. We’ll pay special attention to practical concerns of running Spark in containers, including networking, access control, persistent storage, and multitenancy. You’ll leave this talk with a better understanding of why you might want to run Spark in containers and some concrete ideas for how to get started doing it.

- title: Big Data and Apache Spark on OpenShift Pt. II
  presentor: William Benton
  abstract: |-
    The first meeting of the Big Data Special Interest Group, expanded on a previous Commons session entitled Big Data and Apache Spark on OpenShift (Part 1) which kicked off the Big Data SIG.

    In the previous session, Red Hat’s Will Benton gave us a vocabulary for talking about data-driven applications and outlined some example architectures for building data-driven applications with microservices. In this SIG session, he gave us an introduction to using Apache Spark on OpenShift and walk through an example data-driven application.

- title: Big Data and Apache Spark on OpenShift Pt. I
  presentor: William Benton
  abstract: |-
    In this introductory Big Data briefing session, Red Hat’s Will Benton gave an overview into Big Data architecture and concepts to help level the playing field. This video will give us a better understanding of what a data-intensive application should actually look like on a modern container orchestration platform, and to help kick off the OpenShift Common Big Data SIG.

    In this recording, you’ll learn about the anatomy of data-intensive applications, how they come to life, and what they have to accomplish. We walked through a few applications and explored their responsibilities, saw how they use data, discuss trade-offs they must negotiate, and point to some example architectures that make sense for realizing data-intensive applications on OpenShift.

- title: Analyzing Log Data With Apache Spark
  presentor: William Benton
  abstract: |-
    Contemporary applications and infrastructure software leave behind a tremendous volume of metric and log data. This aggregated “digital exhaust” is inscrutable to humans and difficult for computers to analyze, since it is vast, complex, and not explicitly structured. This session will introduce the log processing domain and provide practical advice for analyzing log data with Apache Spark, including:

    * how to impose a uniform structure on disparate log sources;
    * machine-learning techniques to detect infrastructure failures automatically and characterize the text of log messages;
    * best practices for tuning Spark, training models against structured data, and ingesting data from external sources like ElasticSearch; and
    * a few relatively painless ways to visualize your results.

    You’ll have a better understanding of the unique challenges posed by infrastructure log data after this session. You’ll also learn the most important lessons from our efforts both to develop analytic capabilities for an open-source log aggregation service and to evaluate these at enterprise scale.
